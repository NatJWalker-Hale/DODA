misc_scripts contains various utilities for the analysis, including R scripts for ancestral reconstruction 

alignments contains all the alignments used in this study:
* Caryophyllales_3524_outaln.cn: alignment from pyphlawd used for species tree
* Caryophyllales_3524_outpart: partitioning file 
* DODA_full: all DODA sequences used to produce the tree in Figure 6 and Figure S5
* DODA_alpha: the reduced DODAa sequences used to produce the tree in Figure S16
* DODA_asr: the subsampled DODAa alignment used to produce the tree in Fig Figure 7 and Figure S12 

trees contains the newick files of the inferred DODA trees, inferred from the cleaned (-cln) version of each alignment. Labels are Rapid Boostrap Support and SH-aLRT support (RBS/SH). The Caryophyllales tree was inferred from the alignment as is, and branch labels are RBS only.
